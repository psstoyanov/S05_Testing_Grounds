A note on CLion and Visual Studio Code. As of the first public release of UE 4.19, CLion is integrated however the source code accessor does not generate the required files. You can see the message from [reapazor](https://github.com/dotBunny/CLionSourceCodeAccess/commits?author=reapazor) - the creator of [CLionSourceCodeAccess](https://github.com/dotBunny/CLionSourceCodeAccess), [here](https://github.com/dotBunny/CLionSourceCodeAccess/issues/91).
Visual Studio Code has official support since 4.18.
